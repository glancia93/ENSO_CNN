Each file contains target values of ONI (test_y) and the predictors estimead via GDN model 
(best mean and standard deviation denoted as pred_mean and pred_std respectively).

Each name file specifies the charateristics of the sample data;
thus there's a root (forecast_) followed by either "de" (delta, Rossby waves' speed) or "ds" (upwelling feedback)
and the value of the parameter 

For instance "forecast_de05v6sc.csv" denotes delta case, with delta=0.5

The file with the "Reference Case" can either be "de10" or "ds03".
