Each .csv file represent one sample case. 
The name file specificies the sample data, 
e.g. in "fort149_de05v6sc" denotes "delta case" (de), delta parameter is evaluated at 0.5 (05). 
"sc" at the end of the filename denotes the ZC run takes into account the Seasonal Cycle term.

delta  (Rossby Waves speed) is denoted with "de", it follows "fort149_"
delta_s (thermocline feedback) is denoted with "ds", it follows "fort149_"

The "Reference case" is named "fort149_mu27v6sc".

Each file, therefore, contains the averaged value of 4 main physical observables 
(Thermocline depth (h_mean), Sea Surface Temperature (Temperature), the wind speed (wind_speed) and the wind stress noise (tau_x)) 
on the 3.4 Region of the Pacific Ocean.
