# Physics captured by data-based methods in El Nino prediction_PYCODE
Repository with the modules created for the paper " Physics captured by data-based methods in El Nino prediction ". 
The repository contains the following three modules:

## 1. SMOE.py
Salient Map Order Equivalent (...) is here implemented.
This code has been applied to evaluate the saliency maps of the CNN model.

## 2. SUBCODER.py
This provides the sub-coding of the Time-Series features via iterative filtering. 
Butterworth filters are mainly use for this scope either as a low-pass filter or as a band-pass filter.

## 3. ENSO_CNN.py
This containes the implementation of the CNN model used in the paper.
